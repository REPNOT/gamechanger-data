      "PROCEDURES 1 .EXECUTIVE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT .The OPM is responsible for leadership and oversight of the SES and other executive personnel systems government wide , and each federal agency head makes decisions regarding how best to use the executive spaces OPM allocates to the agency .How well each agency manages its executive resources determines its ability to accomplish its mission and to improve government , both through the quality of the executives it attracts and retains and the teamwork that good management creates .Within the Do D Fourth Estate , executive resources are managed primarily through the ERB .2 . EXECUTIVE RESOURCES PLANNING .The executive resources planning process begins with a strategic analysis of current and future executive resource needs , followed by on going evaluations as vacancies become available and mission requirements change .Do D Fourth Estate Component heads will : \n",
      "a . Identify current and anticipated vacancies of SES , SL , and ST positions .\n",
      "b . Analyze the organization to eliminate unnecessary management layers .\n",
      "c . Review each vacant and occupied position in terms of mission , strategic plans and budget projections , and identify positions that will be abolished or restructured to reflect new priorities and goals .\n",
      "d . Analyze positions to determine if individual positions are classifiable above the GS 15 level and if they will be SES , SL , or ST positions .\n",
      "e . Prioritize supportable SES , SL , or ST positions .3 . EXECUTIVE RESOURCES EVALUATION .Do D Fourth Estate Component heads will monitor SES resources on a continuous basis to ensure that SES positions are used to respond effectively to changing conditions .It is good management to reassess and reprioritize SES positions in light of the organization ’s current program requirements , either on an ad hoc basis ( as they become vacant ) or as part of a comprehensive review .This identifies any changes in the duties and responsibilities of the positions since they were established or last reviewed .The approach to an SES position review provides a systematic basis to reaffirm or adjust the distribution of SES resources and respond to an organization ’s current requirements .Organizations will monitor SES resource management on a continuous basis to ensure that SES positions are used to respond effectively to changing conditions .Periodic evaluations , especially those in advance of the biennial allocation request to OPM , will take into account : \n",

      "a . OPM allocates spaces to the head of each federal agency on a biennial cycle as specified in law .Flexibility is built into the allocation process to allow for necessary adjustments ; however , the extent of such adjustments is limited .Organizations are expected to manage their executive resource needs within the levels set during the biennial allocation process to include : \n",
      "( 1 ) Reprogramming existing resources to meet the agency ’s highest priority requirements .\n",
      "( 2 ) Maintaining sufficient flexibility to meet unanticipated needs .When it is not possible to accommodate needs in a timely manner , the Washington Headquarters Services ( WHS ) , Human Resources Directorate ( HRD ) , OSD Senior Executive Management Office ( SEMO ) will work with Do D Fourth Estate entities to identify alternatives to include the possible use of a temporary allocation .\n",
      "b . The OSD SEMO manages the allocation of SES and equivalent positions under the DA ODCMO ’s purview .\n",
      "c . Allocations are distributed among OSD Principal Staff Assistants ( PSAs ) by the DA ODCMO based on Do D missions , requirements , and historical composition .If a PSA ’s requirements exceed the established allocations , Do D Fourth Estate entities can request for a Secretary of Defense Reserve Pool ( SDRP ) or lapse rate resource .A justification for the resource along with full recruitment documentation , as established in volume 3 of this instruction , is required .SDRP and lapse rate resources are temporary in nature , not to exceed 2 years in length .Enduring requirements must be submitted as part of the biennial review or outof cycle request process .Additionally , manpower billets must also be obtained for SES allocations in order to establish a position .5 . BIENNIAL REVIEW .Pursuant to section 3133 of Reference ( g ) , during each evennumbered calendar year , the Do D must examine their SES position needs and submit a written request to OPM for a specific number of SES position allocations for the two succeeding fiscal years ( FYs )( e.g . , a request in December 2010 , which is in FY 2011 , would be for the FY \n",

      "a . Justifications for Requests .Submissions for new allocations under the biennial review must identify the specific positions ( by title and organizational location ) .Justifications must be accompanied with position descriptions and organizational charts .\n",
      "( 1 ) Describe the circumstances for the need ( e.g . , legislative mandate or Presidential directive ; new agency mission or expanded agency program ; succession planning requirements or issues raised by the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) ; mission requirement ; span of control ; and reporting relationship ) .\n",

      "b . Submission Priorities .Submissions must prioritize all current ( i.e . , established ) and proposed positions , whether vacant or encumbered , in terms of their relative contributions to the agency ’s mission requirements .\n",
      "( 1 ) Organizational wide goals and objectives must be identified and prioritized .While an executive may believe a particular position ( e.g . , a deputy or assistant ) is critical to his or her specific program area , the position may not rank as high in relation to the organization ’s mission .\n",
      "( 2 ) Positions in the lowest priority category are those that present opportunities for reprogramming of executive resources , ( i.e . , positions that may be filled at a lower level or abolished ) , as turnover occurs , or positions from which the current incumbent may be reassigned if an appropriate opportunity is identified .Provide an analysis ( including estimated time frames ) of how the organization can best meet its highest priority needs by redirecting resources from lower priority areas .\n",
      "( 3 ) Other considerations may also include changes in functions or programs , overall funding levels , number of vacancies and length of time vacant , and the extent positions do not appear to meet SES criteria .6 . OUT OF CYCLE REQUESTS .OPM gives Do D the opportunity to submit out of cycle requests in the event new , high priority requirements emerge between biennial reviews and existing resources are exhausted .When the USD ( P&R ) issues a call for requests for additional resources , the OSD SEMO will forward that request to the Fourth Estate entities and require the information outlined in section 5 of this enclosure be provided .\n",

      "( b ) Upon OPM approval , the individual may be appointed to the position upon the previous incumbent ’s departure .There is no provision for overlap or dual incumbency of a position .SES non career appointment authorities are made on a case by case basis and are valid only for the individual and position approved .\n",
