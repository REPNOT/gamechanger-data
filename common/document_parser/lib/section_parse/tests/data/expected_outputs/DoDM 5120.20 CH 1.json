Manned AFN outlets (affiliates) produce local internal information products (such as spot announcements, news, and live radio shows) and insert them into radio and TV streams received from American Forces Network-Broadcast Center (AFN-BC). ", "b. Criteria for Service.  An AFN outlet (radio and TV) may be proposed anywhere outside the continental United States (CONUS) where U.S. Military personnel are stationed on permanent duty if a valid requirement for such service can be demonstrated and concurrence of the host-command and host-government can be obtained.  In considering any request for a new outlet, the following criteria apply: ", "(1) CONUS Exception Criteria.  An outlet normally will not operate within the United States.  Exceptions will be based on the physical location of the installation and activity requesting service and the availability of existing commercial English-language radio and TV service.  These exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis if the Director, AFRTS, determines that a valid requirement exists. ", "(2) Foreign Country Treaties and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Rules Compliance.  An outlet in a foreign country will abide by all existing treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and relevant regulations.  Outlets located where rules of the FCC apply will abide by all applicable FCC rules and regulations. ", "(3) English-Language Availability.  An AFN broadcast outlet will not be established in U.S. territorial possessions and AFN service will not be permitted when English-language TV programs are adequate.  As a general rule, \u201cadequate\u201d is defined as programming that is comparable to that seen or heard on U.S. networks.  The Director, AFRTS, makes the final determination of adequacy based upon recommendations from the requesting command and the appropriate DMA regional command involved. ", "c. Funding Process for Proposed Outlets.  In the event the command requesting an outlet desires AFN service before funding and personnel can be obtained, the requesting command is responsible for providing such resources, including those for all personnel authorizations (military and civilian). ", "d. Requesting Service.  Commanders will work with the DMA regional command and the Combatant Command for their region to prepare a request for service.  The request will be forwarded through the chain-of-command (major command, component, task force) to Headquarters (HQ) AFRTS.  AFRTS component will determine whether funds, personnel, ", "equipment, administrative, and logistics support can be made available before recommending approval or disapproval to the Director, AFRTS. ", "e. Requesting Program Materials.  For new outlets requiring AFRTS program materials (satellite delivery services or portable media), the appropriate DMA regional commands will furnish HQ AFRTS, AFN-BC and the appropriate Combatant Command, an advisory at least 90 days before the planned activation date, and an updated advisory 30 days before the firm activation date. ", "f. U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) Ships", "(1) U.S. Navy.  Since no host-government\u2019s approval or frequencies are involved, every U.S. Navy ship (including submarines) automatically becomes an AFN outlet as soon as a Shipboard Information, Training, and Entertainment (SITE) closed circuit radio and TV system is installed onboard the ship.  HQ AFRTS must be included on the initial activation message for each newly installed shipboard system.  This message becomes the source document for determining affiliation and start-up of AFRTS services.  The U.S. Navy Chief of Information (CHINFO) supervises SITE installations, programming start-up, and program circuiting for Navy ships. ", "(2) MSC Ships as AFRTS Outlets.  MSC ships with U.S. Military personnel assigned to their crews are eligible to become AFN outlets.  MSC requests for service, playback equipment, and program media are processed and managed by CHINFO. HQ AFRTS must be included on the initial on-air message for each ship.  This message becomes the source document for determining affiliation and start-up of AFRTS services. ", "g. Direct-to-Home (DTH) AFN Service for Units", "(1) Description of Service.  Similar to commercial satellite services in the United States, DTH is an unmanned service consisting of a receive-only satellite dish and decoder (which must be activated from the AFN-BC) directly connected to one or more TVs or an in-house cable system.  It provides multiple channels of TV and radio news and entertainment programming direct from AFN-BC and includes global, regional, and local internal information.  The signal may not be rebroadcast.  It may be used in a common viewing or listening area or on an in-house cable distribution system designed to serve an authorized DoD audience.  Another service called Direct-to-Sailor carries three channels of AFN and is available to units worldwide and ships at sea. ", "(2) Criteria for Service.  Eligibility for unmanned AFRTS service is determined by desired use and is generally limited to serve units\u2019 common viewing areas or in-house cable systems.

If it is not issued, the individual must purchase or lease the system from Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), another authorized user, or through AFRTS.  Full instructions for requests for service of all types, including the forms, can be found on the AFN website, www.myafn.net. ", "i. Modifications of Existing AFRTS Outlets", "(1) Except for ships at sea, the geographic location of an AFN outlet will not be changed without prior approval of the Director, AFRTS.  Changes to shipboard systems are not \nauthorized without prior approval of CHINFO Afloat Media Systems and the Naval Sea Systems Command. ", "(2) Any proposed changes or modifications to equipment that may materially alter the type of broadcast, the broadcast coverage area, or will result in a condition contrary to any host-country agreements, will be made only with prior approval of the Director, AFRTS, through the DMA regional command and in coordination with the appropriate Combatant Command.  The Director, AFRTS, will be advised in advance of such proposed changes.

U.S. Military-Produced Programming Other Than AFN.  Programs of appropriate content and adequate technical quality produced by official U.S. Military sources (e.g., the internal information activities of the Military Departments) are authorized for use by AFN affiliates with approval by the appropriate DMA regional command or CHINFO (for ships), and AFN-BC. ", "g. Foreign Programming of Cultural or Informational Value.  In certain instances, programs, events, or ceremonies broadcast by a foreign government or agency may be considered of sufficient cultural or informational value to warrant broadcast by AFN affiliates.  No broadcast of this nature will be made without the expressed permission of the originating or controlling foreign government or agency.  Written concurrence of the host-country team is also required before such programs will be used.  Additionally, the appropriate DMA regional command will be consulted and the Director, AFRTS, and AFN-BC affiliate relations will be notified before airing such program. ", "h. Local AFRTS Outlet Programming.  AFRTS will authorize and encourage regional commands and the AFN affiliates under their command to produce as much regional and local products as their assets and resources will allow. ", "i. Navy SITE Systems.  Shipboard SITE systems are the only authorized systems to be used to playback information, training, and educational materials and for Navy Motion Picture Service products. ", "3. RESTRICTIONS.  AFN program materials will not be used:", "a. For non-AFN broadcast purposes, including private parties, functions, and events.", "\tb. On foreign or domestic commercial, private, or government-owned broadcasting affiliates or cable systems without specific authorization from the Director, AFRTS. ", "\tc. In a program produced by, or originating from, a non-AFN military organization and broadcast by a commercial station. ", "\td.

The majority of the audience at the remote location is not comprised of foreign nationals.", "5. FOREIGN LANGUAGE BROADCASTS.  Affiliate broadcasts in other than the English language may not be made without obtaining approval from the Director, AFRTS, except:", "a.

Ensuring Integrity of Commercial News Programs.  DoD assures the U.S. commercial and public networks that it will protect the integrity of all news programs and materials.  No changes will be made in the editorial content of any news programs and materials that are broadcast. ", "b. Principle of Fairness.  AFN-BC and AFN outlets\u2019 news will be guided by the principle of fairness.  This principle recognizes the right of AFRTS audiences to enjoy access to diverse topics and contrasting perspectives.  AFN-BC and AFN outlets will provide reasonable opportunities for such access. ", "7. POLITICAL PROGRAMMING", "a. AFN outlets will not originate any political programming.  The FCC requires equal opportunities for political candidates, except in newscasts, news interviews, news documentaries, and spot coverage of news events.  Since AFN will not accept nor originate programs from political candidates and only carries FCC-exempted programming, equal opportunity is not an issue. ", "b. AFN-BC will provide a free flow of political programming from U.S. commercial and public networks.  AFN-BC, DMA regional commands, and their AFN affiliates will maintain the same equal opportunities balance offered by these sources.  AFN affiliates should make extensive use of such programming, especially during Presidential election years, and should provide their audience with the political analyses, commentaries, and public affairs programs provided by AFN-BC.  AFN will neither produce nor accept programming from political candidates. ", "8. SPOT ANNOUNCEMENTS", "a. Informational Spot Announcements Replace Commercials.  AFN provides commanders with guidance and completed information spots for the dissemination of information to military personnel.  These spots, for both radio and TV, replace the commercial advertisements within information and entertainment programs otherwise seen on commercial programming. ", "b. AFRTS Non-Commercial Status.  AFRTS is an entity of DoD and, as such, is a non-commercial broadcast organization.  Except as stated, no commercial products or profit-making organizations (except sanctioned morale, welfare, and recreation activities) may be mentioned in AFRTS spot announcements.  In addition, AFN will only air education spots for non-DoD colleges and universities that are under contract with the DoD, and then only by using the base ", "education office as the focal point for all contact.  No AFN spots will uniquely highlight any particular college or university. ", "c. CFC and Other DoD-Sanctioned Fund Drives.  Spots will not be used to solicit funds directly or indirectly unless specifically approved by RTPO.  Exceptions are spot announcements produced for the annual overseas CFC if they are general in nature and do not highlight a single agency.  AFN affiliates may also produce generic spot announcements that support fund drives sanctioned by the Military Departments and their major commands, such as Army Emergency Relief, Navy Relief Society, Air Force Aid Society, and similar campaigns. ", "d. Command-Sponsored Publicity.  Spot announcements will not publicize gambling or games of chance, unless such activities are organized within the U.S. Military communities and authorized by local commanders for purposes of charity or morale and welfare.

Spot announcements will be restricted to mentioning where tickets are available but will not encourage participation in the lottery. ", "\te. Membership Drive Publicity.  AFN will not air spots that promote membership based organizations or that promote non-DoD websites that solicit donations. ", "\tf. Approval to Use Non-AFRTS Spots.  Non-AFRTS produced spots will not be aired unless approved in advance by RTPO. ", "g. Use of Brand Names and Prices in Spots.  Spot announcements will not mention the brand name of any product.  To do so may be considered a DoD endorsement and provide unfair competition with other products.  This includes those products that carry the AAFES brand name, and Navy and Marine Corps Exchange products.  Brand names may be mentioned in news stories if they are an integral part of the news story.  However there are some exceptions: ", "(1) Local Swap Shop or Trading Post Programs.  Brand names may be used in local swap shop or trading post programs when advertising personal items for sale or exchange by authorized members of the audience.

Affiliates may mention the name of a commercial sponsor, along with other pertinent facts, in news stories and local announcements concerning DoD, USO-sponsored shows and programs. ", "(3) Naming Commercial Brands as Command-Sponsored Prizes.  AFN affiliates may mention the names of commercial products or companies to identify specific prizes in contests sponsored by military command activities. ", "(4) Use of Prices in Spots.  Prices will not be mentioned for products except for local swap shop programs and/or to advise the audience of specific upcoming local events and services.  There must be no editorializing of the price. ", "\th. Spot Compliance and Consistency to DoD Policy.  Any spot announcement aired on AFN, regardless of where or by whom it was produced, must comply with DoD objectives. ", "\ti. Spot Use Adheres to Guidelines.  Spot announcements released by RTPO must comply with the same guidelines and policies as any other program material released by AFN-BC. ", "9. EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENTS", "a. Command Written Policy Required.  Regional commands will determine emergency announcement policies.  Policies will include what constitutes an emergency announcement, how it will be aired, and the process for emergency announcement verification and approval.  The degree of emergency and the possible effects any AFN emergency announcements might have upon the host country and all U.S. citizens in the host country must be carefully considered in formulating such policy. ", "(1) In the event the policy authorizes the airing of emergency announcements, AFN affiliates will broadcast such announcements only upon explicit clearance from the competent authority authorized to release the information and the AFN affiliate manager who is responsible for verifying the emergency requirement. ", "(2) Based on command policy, emergency announcements on local AFN affiliates may be pre-approved by the DoD Components in advance of an expected emergency such as evacuation of family members, natural disasters.

For large scale, such as regional exercises, coordination will be between the DMA regional command and DoD Component level. ", "c. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Announcements.  Regional commanders will be responsible for ensuring provisions for using AFN services during a NEO are in the applicable operations plan. ", "10. RELIGIOUS PROGRAM MATERIALS", "a. Religious Programming.  The Armed Forces Chaplains Board (AFCB) liaison, the Director of Religious Programming at the AFN-BC, approves all religious programming, to include programs and spots, before it is scheduled on AFN TV and AFN Radio.  No religious programming may be used without prior AFCB review and approval.  No religious programming will be produced locally.  Religious programming received from other sources may be forwarded to the AFCB liaison for a determination on their use. ", "b. Religious Spots.  All radio and TV religious spots are reviewed and approved by the AFCB liaison and by RTPO.  No religious spots may be used without prior AFCB review and ", "approval.  All religious spots must meet the AFCB guidelines.  Spots received from other sources may be forwarded to the AFCB liaison for a determination on their use.  Religious TV spots are normally inserted into AFN-BC broadcasts during airing of religious programming only. ", "c. Local Religious Spots.  Affiliates may produce command information spots that only inform the audience of times, dates, and places of authorized local military religious services and events.  Such announcements will not promote participation or membership in one religious group over another, nor will local spot announcements espouse the doctrine of any specific religion.  Since they are command information spots they can be scheduled in any programming. ", "11. LOCAL NEWS PRODUCTION", "a. Factual, Accurate, and Unbiased News Reporting.  The content, format, and presentation of local news products will be factual, fair, and unbiased.  AFN affiliates will not conduct investigative reporting.  AFN affiliates will not function as news gathering or news support bureaus for commercial news organizations. ", "b. Coordination with Local Public Affairs on Local News  Products.  AFN regions and affiliates will produce news products on subjects of interest and/or concern within the communities and commands served.  Local news reports will be fully attributed as to source. News products will be coordinated, when appropriate, with public affairs offices. ", "12. PRODUCTION OF NON-AFRTS MATERIAL.  AFN personnel (with the exception of U.S.", "Navy Mass Communication Specialists serving aboard U.S. Navy and MSC Ships) or AFN equipment (including SITE systems) will not be used to produce non-AFRTS briefings, image products (e.g., hooah videos) or distinctly external media products.", "13. MANPOWER.  AFRTS utilizes a joint work force that must be staffed and supported by the Military Departments.", "a. AFRTS Manning Requirements, Authorizations, and Staffing.  DMA publishes and maintains the DMA Master Manning Document.  This document provides the worldwide DMA work force requirements, authorizations, staffing level, and Military Department composition of all DMA locations and is the source document to obtain required work force from the Military Departments.  DMA regional commands will review their manning document annually.  Change recommendations are forwarded to HQ AFRTS for further staffing and coordination. ", "b. Proportionate Share of AFRTS Staff.  The proportionate share mix of the authorized and required staff will be based upon the size of the authorized audience of each Military Department within the geographic area, as reported by the Combatant Command Population Statistics Report. ", "For purposes of personnel authorizations, audience includes military personnel, DoD civilians, and command-sponsored family members. ", "c. Military Department Staffing Responsibilities.

The preferred arrangement is for all AFN services, both video and audio, be offered to DoD personnel on cable, free of any charges.  This arrangement is not always practical because of the expense of operating a cable distribution system.  Every effort should be made to offer as many AFN services as possible at little or no cost to the audience.  Charging a nominal fee to offset the expense of a cable box and maintenance of the distribution system is authorized. ", "2. On multi-tiered cable systems, there may be conditions in which the primary entertainment channel (e.g., AFN Prime Pacific in the Asia region) and AFN News and AFN Sports are offered on a no-cost or maintenance-only-cost tier, and AFN Spectrum and the other region\u2019s entertainment channel (e.g., AFN Prime Atlantic) are offered on the lowest-priced basic tier along with a variety of other commercial channels.

Contractors and/or individual units (if such is the case) must provide the component commander and AFRTS detailed proof that they have the distribution rights to the programming being offered for the specific manner and location in which they will be delivered.  The responsibility to obtain and document copyright clearances rests with the individual cable contractor or unit, but must still be submitted with requests for approval.  The detailed approval must be in writing and signed by the programming source and the content provider (e.g., MTV, TNT, A&E, SKY-TV).
