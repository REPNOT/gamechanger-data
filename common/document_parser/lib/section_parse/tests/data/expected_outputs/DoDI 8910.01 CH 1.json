Prior to collecting information, users requiring the information must ensure that the information to be collected is not duplicative of information already available. When information is not already available, users must ensure that: (1) Other methods (e.g., statistical sampling) that will minimize the information collection burden cannot be used. (2) The information collection request is essential to the mission of the requesting organization and the cost of the collection is worth the benefit derived from it. b. Information collections must be designed to meet only essential needs and be as infrequent as feasible, with reasonable due dates. The number of copies to be prepared must be held to a minimum. One-time information collections may not be imposed when the need for a recurring information collection is indicated. c. Information collected from the public as defined in Reference (d), OSD and DoD Components, and other federal agencies must be minimized, accounted for, and controlled. (1) Part 1320 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (h)) directs that public information collections be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval and assigned an OMB control number, and that an annual information collection budget of burden hours be developed and submitted to the OMB. (2) Information collections that are within the requesting OSD or DoD Component must be approved and assigned a Component information collection control symbol. (3) DoD information collections, where information across OSD or DoD Components is collected, must be approved and licensed with a DoD internal information collection report control symbol (RCS) prior to the collection of such information, in accordance with Reference (d). (4) An interagency information collection requirement must be processed in accordance with Reference (d). d. The OSD and DoD Components must not respond to information collections that have not been properly approved and licensed with an information collections control symbol. e.

Collections of information that contain personal information on individuals require special handling in accordance with DoDI 5400.11 (Reference (j)) and DoD 5400.11-R (Reference (k)). Such information included in a proposed collection of information must be accessible to the public only as prescribed by DoDD 5400.07 (Reference (l)). To ensure personal information in electronic form is only acquired and maintained when necessary, and that the supporting information technology that is being developed and used protects and preserves the privacy of the members of the public, a privacy impact assessment of information collections must be conducted in accordance with DoDI 5400.16 (Reference (m)). g. When an information collection has been approved and licensed with an information collection control symbol, and the information is collected, it must be made visible, available, and usable only to authorized individuals.", "4.
