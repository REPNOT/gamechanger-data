Provide periodic, mandatory education and training in EO and human relations at installation and fleet unit commands, during pre-commissioning programs and initial entry training, and throughout professional military education (PME) systems, as part of the overall effort to achieve EO within the Department of Defense. This training shall be provided to all Service members, enlisted and officer, including flag and general officers. The training shall include comprehensive material on leadership roles and responsibilities for EO programs, complaints processing, legal implications, reprisal prevention and detection, climate assessment methodologies, and managing civilian equal employment opportunity (EEO) systems. 4.6. Provide for an environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment. (See items E2.1.15. and E2.1.16., enclosure 2.) 4.7. Ensure that all on-base activities and, to the extent of the ability of the Department of Defense, any off-base activities available to military personnel are open to all military personnel and their family members regardless of race, color, religion, age, physical or mental disability, sex, or national origin, as called for by the DoD Human Goals Charter (reference (b)). 4.7.1. Organizations or administering activities that do not meet this requirement shall be denied the use of military facilities and resources in accordance with DoD Directive 5410.18 (reference (g)). 4.7.2. Organizations that use on-base facilities, whether on a reimbursable basis or otherwise, must satisfy the responsible area or activity commander that they do not unlawfully discriminate through their membership requirements or in any of their activities. 4.8. Oppose discrimination in off-base housing directed against DoD personnel and their family members. Each commander shall take actions to overcome such discrimination and to impose off-limits sanctions in housing cases, as required by DoD Instruction 1100.16 (reference (h)). 4.9.

Establishes procedures for recurring annual reviews of DEOMI services and a biennial review of DEOMI curricula. 6.2. The Secretaries of the Military Departments are responsible for EO and for ensuring compliance with this Directive within their respective Services and shall: 6.2.1. Ensure that all DoD EO policies and programs are understood and executed at all levels of military command and that EO programs and protection extend to Service members who serve in joint-duty positions. 6.2.2. Require commanders to assess their organizational EO climate, preferably as part of their assumption of command, and schedule follow-up assessments periodically during their command tenure. Commanders shall be held accountable for the EO climates in their commands. See item E2.1.7., enclosure 2. 6.2.3. Continuously review and update documents and eliminate practices that unlawfully discriminate against military personnel based on race, religion, color, sex, or national origin. 6.2.4. Develop policies to prevent unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment, and require that commanders prominently post and enforce them. Personnel should be made aware of the policies and procedures for filing a complaint of reprisal under DoD Directive 7050.6 (reference (l)). Violations of the policies set forth in this Directive may constitute violations of specific articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (reference (m)). 6.2.5. Establish and publish complaint procedures. These procedures shall cover both formal and informal means for resolving complaints and shall include timelines for resolution (normally 60 days), feedback, and follow-up mechanisms, as well as examples of prohibited reprisal actions and measures that can be taken to counter these actions. Reserve component timelines should take drilling periods into account. To deal effectively with reprisals in the Reserve components, follow-up on sexual harassment and discrimination cases in the National Guard and Reserves should extend through a period of 1 year following conflict resolution. Ensure that all discrimination complaints are investigated in a fair, impartial, and prompt manner, and that all reports of investigation of formal complaints are reviewed for legal sufficiency. Ensure that appropriate disciplinary and corrective actions are taken if unlawful discrimination or reprisal is substantiated. 6.2.6. Feed back information about both the status and outcome of the complaint; e.g., who is investigating, projected completion date, and whether the allegations were substantiated. When requested, the complainant should be provided a copy of the investigating officer's final report, redacted as necessary to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (reference (k)) and other applicable laws and regulations. Information about specific adverse actions taken against an individual is generally not disclosed unless such information is a matter of public record (e.g., court-martial proceedings) or when otherwise required to be released by statute. 6.2.7. Develop forms for the documentation of each step in the formal complaint process, including pre-decision updates and post-decision follow-ups with the complainant consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (reference (k)) and implementing DoD guidance. Complaint forms and reporting systems should clearly identify the duty status involved in Reserve component cases. Service members should be encouraged to file complaints promptly, normally within 60 days of the incident. 6.2.8. Provide a central point of contact at the installation level or below, staffed with qualified and trained EO counselors, to receive formal complaints of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment. 6.2.9. Establish toll-free or local hot (or advice) lines that provide information on how and where to file complaints and what kinds of behaviors constitute unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment. Personnel working these lines shall be fully trained to address National Guard and Reserve component situations in addition to those on active duty. 6.2.10. Establish criteria for the appeal of administrative findings of formal complaints of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment. The sole mechanism for appealing the disposition of an informal complaint shall be to file a formal complaint. The first-level appeal of an administrative finding on a formal complaint should be to an installation-level commander, or, in the case of personnel not assigned to an installation (e.g., on ships), to the first commander in the chain with general court-martial convening authority. Subsequent and final appeal procedures should be established within each Service at the level of the Secretary of the Military Department. The appeal procedure should not be an adversarial process, nor does it require personal appearances or hearing rights. The Secretary or other designated official will decide the appeal based on the written record and any written arguments submitted with the appeal. The appeal authority may sustain or overrule the finding below or remand the matter for further fact-finding. 6.2.10.1. Both the complainant and the subject(s) of the complaint may appeal administrative findings of discrimination or no discrimination. 6.2.10.2. To avoid delaying or impeding the prompt and effective resolution of complaints, commanders are not required to withhold appropriate administrative action while an appeal is pending. 6.2.10.3. This administrative appeal process is not applicable to findings rendered pursuant to command action under the UCMJ (reference (m)) (i.e., nonjudicial punishment or court-martial). When a commander initiates or has previously initiated action under reference (m), that action shall take precedence over any ongoing or contemplated administrative actions or appeals. In such circumstances, reference (m) appellate processes are the exclusive appellate mechanisms available. 6.2.11. Ensure that victims' support programs provide information on services, and assistance in obtaining them. The Services shall ensure that programs for counseling, information, referral, and other assistance are made available to Service members who have experienced unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment. 6.2.12. Establish and fill sufficient full-time staff positions and allocate sufficient resources to conduct all EO programs. Qualifications and grades of personnel serving in EO billets shall be specified. EO staff personnel shall be selected for training at DEOMI by Service-established criteria and placed upon assignment at a level that enables them to communicate effectively the goals and objectives of the program and to obtain the understanding, support, commitment, and involvement of the organization's leaders. The professional development training of EO staff personnel shall include continuing education and training to ensure mastery and competency in the EO field. 6.2.13. Ensure that all personnel not assigned to EO billets, but having program-associated responsibilities, such as inspectors general (IGs), chaplains, judge advocates, investigating officers, and personnel working in victims' assistance and support programs, receive such training as may be necessary for them to carry out their EO duties. Service-developed training plans for such personnel should be submitted to DEOMI for review and comment. 6.2.14. Ensure that all military personnel, including command selectees and flag and general officers, receive adequate training in EO, human relations, and prevention of sexual harassment on a recurring basis, and at all levels of PME. Service-wide training programs, when not conducted by DEOMI personnel, shall be submitted to DEOMI for prompt review and comment. 6.2.15. Ensure that all rating and reviewing officials evaluate a member's compliance with DoD and Component directives prohibiting unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment and document serious or repeated deviations from such directives in performance reports. 6.2.16. Ensure that Reserve component members' off-duty or non-duty behaviors that affect the military workplace are covered by the unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment prevention programs, emphasizing the principle of \"full-time values - part-time careers.\" An example of off-duty or non-duty behavior that impacts on the workplace is quid pro quo (something for something) sexual harassment. See items E2.1.15.1. & E2.1.15.2., enclosure 2. 6.2.17. Recognize the unique characteristics of the Reserve components when establishing programs and procedures for processing unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment involving members of the Reserve components, whether as complainants or respondents. 6.2.18. Develop management information and reporting systems to determine the progress for each AAP goal, consistent with DoD Instruction 1350.3 (reference (f)). 6.2.19. Forward a fiscal year report to the USD(P&R) outlining their progress in achieving the established MEO objectives of their AAPs. This report shall be due each year on February 1, and is described further in reference (f). 6.3. The Commanders of the Combatant Commands and Directors of Defense Agencies under OSD Principal Staff Assistants and those that report directly to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for EO within their respective areas of responsibility and ensure compliance with the policies set forth in this Directive. Because such Agency heads generally do not exercise career management or UCMJ authority (reference (m)) over assigned military personnel, special consideration must be exercised in meeting DoD EO standards for assigned personnel. At a minimum, they shall: 6.3.1. Ensure that all DoD EO policies and programs are understood and executed throughout the organization, to include: 6.3.1.1. Establishing an EO program that complies with the guidelines of this Directive and reflects the standards, values, and principles of existing Service programs, resources, and counseling services. Commanders and Agency heads should be aware that some Service members may only know of, or be comfortable using, their parent Service's complaint system. These individuals should not be denied the benefit of their parent Service's EO and counseling systems if necessary to ensure the DoD standards on complaint handling are met for each member. 6.3.1.2. Appointing an assigned EO advisor who will initiate the administrative processes and prepare initial reports for the commander's or director's review and disposition. Generally, these positions need not be full-time, but incumbents should receive DEOMI-approved training that enables them to administer a responsive EO program. 6.3.1.3. Establishing and publishing procedures for appealing the findings of formal complaints of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment that comply with subparagraphs 6.2.4. through 6.2.11., above. Appeal procedures should provide for referral to appropriate general courts martial convening authority. Subsequent and final appeal procedures should end at the level of the respondent's or complainant's Military Department Secretary. To the extent commanders and Agency heads rely on the installation host Service to provide complaint processing, investigation support, and counseling or referral services, these relationships should be formally established and published. 6.3.2. Ensure that appropriate disciplinary and corrective actions are taken if unlawful discrimination or reprisal is substantiated. If the appropriate administrative or disciplinary sanction is not within the supervising commander's or director's authority (e.g., nonjudicial punishment, promotion removal actions, or administrative separation actions), refer the case to the offender's installation host Service or Service command element for disposition and action. 6.4. The Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force shall ensure that the Chief, National Guard Bureau, fulfills his or her responsibilities for EO within his or her jurisdiction, fully consistent with the broader DoD objectives and 42 U.S.C. 2000d (reference (n)) and shall establish discrimination and sexual harassment complaints procedures that include: 6.4.1. All the provisions of subparagraphs 6.2.4. through 6.2.11., above. 6.4.2. Both the Army and Air National Guard. 6.4.3. The provision that the National Guard Bureau maintain final review or decision authority over discrimination complaints within its purview.", "7.

Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
