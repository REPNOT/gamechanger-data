A covered entity or business associate must permit the Secretary of HHS access during normal business hours to its facilities, books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, including PHI, that are pertinent to ascertaining compliance with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA rules.

In addition to responsibilities for compliance with this issuance, DoD covered entities are also responsible for compliance with DoD Privacy Program issuances. ", "(1)  Although nothing in this issuance violates DoD Privacy Program issuances, compliance with this issuance does not necessarily satisfy all the requirements of the DoD Privacy Program issuances.  For example, an authorized disclosure under Paragraph 4.4. may require additional actions, such as the establishment of a \u201croutine use\u201d in the system of records notice for the system of records in which the PHI is maintained, which specifically identifies to whom the disclosure is made and for what purpose.

Nothing in this issuance gives an individual a right to initiate a legal action in court for any alleged violations.

However, in any case in which FOIA requires disclosure, nothing in this Manual prohibits disclosure. ", "(3)  Requests under FOIA are handled in accordance with DoDM 5400.07.

In addition to responsibilities for compliance with this issuance, DoD covered entities are also responsible for compliance with DoD Privacy Program issuances. ", "(1)  Although nothing in this issuance violates DoD Privacy Program issuances, compliance with this issuance does not necessarily satisfy all the requirements of the DoD Privacy Program issuances.  For example, an authorized disclosure under Paragraph 4.4. may require additional actions, such as the establishment of a \u201croutine use\u201d in the system of records notice for the system of records in which the PHI is maintained, which specifically identifies to whom the disclosure is made and for what purpose. ", "(2)  Compliance with the DoD Privacy Program issuances in connection with PHI does not necessarily satisfy all the requirements of this issuance.  For example, an authorized routine use of medical records under the DoD Privacy Program issuances is not necessarily a permitted use or disclosure under this issuance.

Nothing in this issuance gives an individual a right to initiate a legal action in court for any alleged violations.

Relationship to Section 552 of Title 5, U.S.C., Also Known as the \u201cFreedom of Information Act (FOIA).\u201d ", "(1)  In general, FOIA requires federal agencies to make available the records in the possession of the agencies to members of the public who request them.  FOIA, however, is subject to exemptions, such as when such disclosure would cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of an individual or privacy of other individuals such as a deceased individual\u2019s surviving family members.

However, in any case in which FOIA requires disclosure, nothing in this Manual prohibits disclosure. ", "(3)  Requests under FOIA are handled in accordance with DoDM 5400.07.  Application of FOIA exemptions to information about deceased individuals requires a different analysis than that applicable to living individuals and is provided in Paragraph 4.5.h. ", "3.3.
