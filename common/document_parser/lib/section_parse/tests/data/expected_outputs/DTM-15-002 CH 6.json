A NID does not: ", "\t(1)  Authorize disclosure of classified information to a foreign government, a non-U.S. citizen, or a non-U.S. entity.

If a GCA requires a contractor cleared under an SSA to have access to proscribed information, DSS will take actions to propose an initial NID to the applicable GCA for response, in accordance with the provisions of this DTM, instead of the actions set forth in paragraphs 3d(3)(c) and 3e of Enclosure 3 of Reference (b).

Coordination of a proposed NID between DSS and a GCA must confirm that release of the proscribed information to the U.S. contractor is consistent with the national security interests of the United States.

DSS will take the following actions to propose a NID to the applicable GCA in accordance with the procedures in this DTM.
