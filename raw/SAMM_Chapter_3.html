These objectives include ensuring that: critical U.S. military technological advantages are preserved; transfers that could prove detrimental to U.S. security interests are controlled and limited; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery are prevented; and diversion of defense-related goods to terrorists is prevented. At the same time, the sharing of defense technology, properly controlled, is a valuable way to ensure our allies and partners participate with the United States in future military operations. In applying export control and technology security policies, due recognition will be given to the importance of interoperability with allies and coalition partners and to impacts on the defense industrial base. DoD will apply export control and other technology security policies and procedures in a way that balances economic and scientific interests with those of national security. It is important that these considerations be taken into account prior to any commitment to disclose or release controlled defense-related information or technology. <a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T1.'>Table C3.T1.</a> provides definitions for categories of controlled defense-related information and technology discussed in this chapter.

	When potential sales of sensitive or classified defense articles or information will require inter-agency technology security and foreign disclosure (TSFD) release determinations are identified in the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Sales Forecast within Categories of A or B, or when the Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) becomes aware of credible demand signals (i.e. written or verbal statements from senior procurement officials) indicating a probable submission of a Letter of Request (LOR) for Price and Availability (P&A) or Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA), or a Request for Information (RFI) or Request for Proposal (RFP) for such items, the SCO should develop a Pre-LOR Assessment Request (PAR), as described in 
	<a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T2.'>Table C3.T2.</a>, to inform the inter-agency community and prepare the cognizant Implementing Agency (IA) to initiate TSFD processes for the timely release determinations. When no formal LOR is available, a PAR serves in place of an LOR and Country Team Assessment (CTA) as grounds for the IA to initiate applicable foreign disclosure and technology security release processes. Note that the PAR cannot be used as an LOR for any other purpose.

	<span class="PNumber">C3.1.2.1.</span>
	</a>
	<span class="PTitle"></span>
	In the preparation of the PAR, the SCO consults with the IAs, including their Foreign Disclosure Office for releasability and technical information, and the relevant Combatant Command (CCMD). When complete, the SCO forwards the PAR to the CCMD. As the PAR is an extraordinary process, a CCMD endorsement is required in each case to support initiation of the TSFD release processes. The CCMD comments in the endorsement on each of the elements in <a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T2.'>Table C3.T2.</a> addressed in the PAR. The PAR and CCMD endorsement are forwarded to Joint Staff, the applicable IA, and the DSCA by the CCMD. This process forms the basis for a collaborative effort to analyze the recipient nation's military requirements in order to identify a capability that fulfills those requirements and initiates the DoD’s TSFD requirements to meet the partner's acquisition needs.

	<a href='https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/523011p.pdf' target='_blank'>DoD Directive (DoDD) 5230.11</a> implements National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1). It is U.S. national and DoD policy that Classified Military Information (CMI) is a national security asset that must be protected and shared with foreign governments only when there is a clearly defined benefit to the United States, when authorized by officials designated under the Directive and then only when all requirements of the Directive are met.

	<span class="PTitle">Avoiding False Impressions.</span>
	U.S. policy is to avoid creating false impressions of USG readiness to make available classified military materiel, technology, or information. Much military hardware is unclassified; however, its operation and maintenance or related training may involve sensitive classified information. Some classified information (e.g., sensitive compartmented information (SCI), communications security (COMSEC) information, etc.) may require approval outside of DoD and the National Disclosure Policy Committee (NDPC). Accordingly, proposals to foreign governments or international organizations that result from either U.S. or combined (U.S. and proposed recipient) initial planning, and that will lead to the eventual disclosure of classified military information, must be authorized in advance by designated disclosure officials in the departments and agencies originating the information or by the NDPC. This includes the release of unclassified Price and Availability (P&A) data. Furthermore, it must be explicitly stated and acknowledged that no U.S. commitment to furnish such classified information or materiel is intended or implied until disclosure has been approved.

	Under the terms of NDP-1, the NDPC is the central authority for formulating, promulgating, administering, and monitoring national disclosure policy. The Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense are the only officials who may grant unilateral exceptions to NDP-1. However, in most cases, exceptions to policy are granted or denied by the NDPC. Under 
	<a href='https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/523011p.pdf' target='_blank'>DoDD 5230.11</a>, the Secretary of Defense has delegated disclosure authority to the Secretaries of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) and other DoD officials whose decisions must be compliant with NDP-1. They are required to appoint a Principal Disclosure Authority (PDA) at component headquarters level to oversee the disclosure process and a Designated Disclosure Authority (DDA) at subordinate command and agency levels to oversee disclosure decisions at their level when disclosure authority is delegated. Any commitment to disclosure or release of controlled defense-related information or technology must be authorized by the PDA or DDA unless authority is otherwise delegated in a Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL).

An affirmative disclosure decision requires consent of the PDA or DDA representing the DoD Component that originated the information and the written consent of the official having original classification authority for the information if the information has not already been marked by the originator for disclosure to the intended recipient government or international organization. The PDA or DDA must also ensure that the disclosure criteria, conditions, and limitations in

In the absence of a GSA, the security requirements may be included in a program agreement (e.g., a co-production or cooperative development memorandum of understanding (MOU)), or in a program-specific security agreement described in <a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.2.6.'>Section C3.2.6.</a> Disclosure authorizations for classified information are recorded in the National Disclosure Policy System (NDPS). The chief of the U.S. diplomatic mission must approve in-country release of all security assistance (SA) information to a purchaser.

If the release involves classified information or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), the release must be approved by the supporting DDA. Classified dollar levels of proposed programs may be released only with permission of the Director, DSCA, and Department of State (State) concurrence. U.S. officials releasing information under this paragraph must ensure that the recipient understands that the release does not constitute a commitment by the United States.

LOAs, however, are not international agreements. If CMI is to be released in support of an FMS sale, and there is no GSOIA or GSOMIA, a program specific security agreement developed and approved by the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) containing the security requirements must be concluded prior to discussion of CMI with the purchasing government.

	U.S. security depends on the proper safeguarding of classified information released to industry. The National Industrial Security Program (NISP) ensures that classified information released to cleared U.S. contractor facilities is safeguarded during all phases of the contracting, licensing, and grant processes. The NISP also applies to all classified information not released under a contract, license certificate, or grant, and to Foreign Government Information (FGI) furnished to contractors that requires protection in the interest of national security. 
	<a href='https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/subtitle-A/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-117' target='_blank'>32 CFR 117</a> and DTM-09-019 provides procedures used by DoD to ensure maximum uniformity and effectiveness in application of NISP policies to industry.

	   Implementing Agencies (IAs) may award (or permit a contractor to award) a classified contract to a foreign contractor if the classified information is releasable to the government of the foreign contractor under NDP-1. Foreign disclosure implications are identified by the program office and resolved by the supporting DDA prior to any announcements that could lead to foreign involvement. Classified information must be requested and transferred through government channels in compliance with the DoD Component documentary request procedures. Prior to any activity that may result in the disclosure of classified information to a foreign contractor, the IA will request that DSS Headquarters International Division seek a Facility Security Clearance Assurance (FSCA) from the security authorities of the foreign contractor. The FSCA verifies the facility security clearance of the foreign contractor and advises the other government that U.S. classified information is to be transferred to a contractor under its jurisdiction under the terms of the relevant bilateral security agreements with the other government. IA responsibilities are contained in 
	   <a href='https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/subtitle-A/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-117' target='_blank'>32 CFR 117</a> and DTM-09-019.

	TDPs are offered for study only when DoD is prepared to release the TDP for production. Foreign manufacture of U.S. equipment benefits the United States when it strengthens friendly defense forces, improves U.S. defense relationships, or enhances interoperability. It may also benefit the United States when it serves to maintain the purchaser’s defense industrial base or to improve general defense capabilities. Requests for TDPs for study or production are normally denied if an article is in limited supply or if foreign production would adversely impact the U.S. industrial base. The IA provides the LOA and information (as specified in 
	<a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T4.'>Table C3.T4.</a>) to the release and disclosure authority for use in making a release determination. If the proposed release involves classified information or CUI, a DDA appointed pursuant to 
	<a href='https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/523011p.pdf' target='_blank'>DoDD 5230.11</a> must approve the decision. The purchaser can be provided technical data and authority necessary to operate and maintain or manufacture the defense article through an LOA, through an international agreement (such as for cooperative development), or through the combination of an LOA and a complementary international agreement in the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or a memorandum of agreement (MOA). See

	USG policy stipulates a “strong presumption to deny” the transfer of MTCR Category I Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) UAVs/Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs). If the Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) becomes aware that the host country is considering submission of an LOR for an MTCR Category I ISR UAV or UCAV prior to development and submission of an LOR for such a system, the SCO should initiate a requirements analysis and pre-screening. This process begins with a Security Cooperation Organization Assessment (SCOA) providing all elements of information in 
	<a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T5.'>Table C3.T5.</a> below. In the preparation of the SCOA, the SCO should consult and confer with the IAs, including the IA’s Foreign Disclosure Office; the Country Team; and the Combatant Command (CCMD). When complete, the SCOA will be forwarded to the CCMD for comment on each of elements 1-17 addressed in the SCOA in a subsequent CCMD Comment. The SCOA and the CCMD Comment should be forwarded to the Joint Staff/J5 and DSCA. This process forms the basis for a collaborative effort, to analyze the recipient nation’s military requirements in order to identify a platform/payload combination (manned aircraft, Cat II UAV/UCAV, or Cat I UAV/UCAV) that fulfills those requirements and complies with the MTCR and other USG security requirements. If the SCO is not able to develop the SCOA in advance of submission of an LOR for an MTCR Category I ISR UAV or UCAV, SCOA required information should be submitted as part of the Country Team Assessment (CTA).

	Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) encompasses systems, procedures, and techniques used to collect and disseminate information. It includes intelligence collection and dissemination networks, command and control networks, and systems that provide the common operational/tactical picture. It also includes information assurance products and services, as well as communications standards that support the secure exchange of information by C4ISR systems. Under the C4ISR umbrella, operators use systems to exchange digital, voice, and video data with appropriate levels of command. The two key aspects of C4ISR systems are access to secure networks controlled by Information Security (INFOSEC) products and services, and classified data processed on C4ISR networks. See Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510.06 series (not for public release) for information on the release of U.S. INFOSEC products (Communications Security (COMSEC), cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic key material, security infrastructure) to foreign purchasers.

	INFOSEC is the protection of information systems against unauthorized access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing, or transit, and against the denial of service to authorized users, including those measures necessary to detect, document and counter such threat. INFOSEC is applied through the application of Cybersecurity and COMSEC.

	COMSEC is the measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons’ information derived from telecommunications and other information systems, and technologies necessary to ensure the authenticity of such communications. COMSEC includes cryptographic security, transmission security, emissions security, and physical security of COMSEC material. Secure telecommunication or information system cryptographic components are the primary COMSEC products for transmission security and commonly called COMSEC devices or products. COMSEC devices are designated Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI).

	CCIs are devices approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) that embody cryptographic logic or other cryptographic design, but do not perform the entire COMSEC function. CCIs are dependent upon host equipment or assemblies to complete and operate COMSEC functions. Un-keyed CCI is unclassified. An item may be designated CCI because its entire component is controlled (e.g. Inline Network Encryptor (INE)), or because the item contains an embedded cryptographic NSA Type-1 certified module to encrypt/de-encrypt information (e.g. secure radio).

	Interoperable systems that exchange classified military information are subject to a disclosure review and approval as defined in National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1). In addition to classified system hardware and software information, all data flowing between foreign and secure U.S. C4ISR weapon systems is classified. Approvals for disclosure of U.S. classified data that transit over secure coalition networks are required before issuance of LOA and/or P&A data.

	The release and transfer process governing INFOSEC/COMSEC products, information, and techniques to foreign governments or international organizations is an intentionally deliberate decision process undertaken by the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) and the NSA Deputy National Manager. These transfers are approved only when there is a clearly defined benefit to USG foreign policy, military, intelligence, or economic objectives.

	The release process for INFOSEC/COMSEC products is defined in CNSS Policy No. 8 (not for public release). INFOSEC/COMSEC products released to these member nations are governed by allied agreements. These, policies and procedures that describe the requirements by which the United States can provide INFOSEC/COMSEC products, technical security material, information, and techniques.

	The release process for INFOSEC/COMSEC products is defined in the CJCSI 6510.06 series. A nation's desire to be interoperable with the United States, or to support the sale of a weapon system is not considered sufficient justification for release. Justification is normally based on CCMD requirements to communicate with foreign governments via secure means or USG foreign policy objectives that necessitate release and transfer of U.S. COMSEC. CCMD validation of requirements normally occurs during their bilateral Command and Control Interoperability Board (CCIB) (or like forum) with the partner nation. Following validation of the interoperability requirement, the CCMD will initiate the COMSEC Release Request (CRR) process to request a Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) release decision. There are two types of CRR release approvals, a Release in Principle (RIP) and Release in Specific (RIS).

	<span class="PTitle">Communications Security Release in Principle.</span>
	A RIP provides a USG policy decision related to release of COMSEC information, products, or services in support of a secure interoperability requirement. A RIP is not an approval to physically transfer any COMSEC product. A RIP is required prior to any detailed discussions with the foreign nation regarding COMSEC products or associated COMSEC information requirements. RIPs are a means to provide proposed solutions to fulfill U.S. secure interoperability requirements.

	Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (e.g., radar warning receivers and jammers) are designed to deny or counteract the enemy's use of electromagnetic (EM) emitters (e.g., radar, communications, guidance, detection, and control devices). The sale of an EW capability involves the transfer of the EW system hardware, firmware, and software. The software typically includes a mission data file (MDF) or library that contains information/data related to EM emitters. The Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Database (EWIRDB) is the primary DoD source for technical parametric performance data on EM emitters and is used to program/reprogram the MDF to correctly identify emitters by their EM characteristics. Prior to offering an LOA to the FMS customer that includes an EW system, the FMS IA must review all EW system components to verify that the system, to include the MDF, has been approved for release and certified in writing by the appropriate DoD authorities (i.e. NSA, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and applicable program offices). If an EW system is not certified in writing prior to sale, the FMS purchaser must be advised, and the FMS IA must ensure a plan is in place to obtain data protection certification from the NSA prior to delivery. Delivery cannot take place without this certification unless the FMS customer uses its own technical parametric performance data instead of DoD data.

	The FMS EWIRDB is used to create the MDF or library for EW systems. There are two types of FMS EWIRDB, Direct and Indirect. A Direct FMS EWIRDB is delivered directly to the FMS customer and provides data required for an In-Country Reprogramming (ICR) capability for the EW system. An Indirect FMS EWIRDB is delivered to the U.S. reprogramming facility that will develop the MDF for the requesting country’s EW system. Both Direct and Indirect EWIRDBs must go through the release processes described below prior to the FMS sale.

	An LOR advisory should be issued to NSA and the applicable MILDEPs by DSCA (IOPS/WPN) when an LOR is received for an EW system that will be used on a country’s weapon system for the first time. This advisory will notify the EW community of the pending request so that the evaluation process can begin. It is critical that the evaluation process be initiated as soon as possible due to the amount of time required to complete the process.

	EW systems that use classified military information are subject to a releasability review and approval as defined in the NDP-1. In addition to possible classified system hardware and software, the system MDF may include classified data. Approvals for release of U.S. classified data are required before an LOA can be offered to a purchaser.

	Prior to offering an LOA for FMS EWIRDB support, there must be an approved and valid Release in Principle (RIP) in place for the use of the Direct or Indirect FMS EWIRDB. The FMS EWIRDB RIP is issued by NSA for a particular country on a specific weapon system platform, and is not related to a COMSEC RIP. Once the IA Program Office or vendor determines there is an FMS EWIRDB requirement, a request for a RIP should be submitted to the appropriate IA EW POC listed in <a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T5.'>Table C3.T5.</a> The IA will designate a POC for receipt of these requirements to ensure consistency in the submissions to the DoD authorities. The request for a RIP will be submitted to the DoD disclosure authorities (<a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T5.'>Table C3.T5.</a>) At a minimum, these requests will identify the requesting country, platform, type of database (Direct/Indirect) and EW system nomenclature, if known. Once the RIP is granted, an LOA for FMS EWIRDB support can be offered to the purchaser. The IA should enter comments in Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS) case remarks stating that an EW RIP has been granted, citing the approving agency, date of grant, and POC.

	Upon implementation of an LOA for an EW system with FMS EWIRDB support, the IA EW POC will coordinate with the country to determine the desired data to be incorporated into the FMS EWIRDB. This information, along with the identified recipient country, platform, type of database (Direct/Indirect) and EW system will be used by the EW points of contact at the applicable IA to develop a request for a RIS. The RIS will be submitted to the DoD disclosure authorities for approval. If approved, the RIS will authorize the EWIRDB executive agent, NASIC, to begin the development of an FMS EWIRDB for a particular country, platform, and EW system as funded by an FMS LOA. <a href='/chapter/chapter-3#C3.T5.'>Table C3.T5.</a> lists organizations and their EW responsibilities.

	Release of U.S. manufactured IFF Mode 4/5 capability to foreign governments must be handled according to the COMSEC release process of CJCSI 6510.06C, Communications Security Releases to Foreign Nations (not for public release). IFF Mode 4/5 is typically approved on a general release basis for U.S. manufactured platforms, which means it is not tied to a specific quantity or platform. A release in specific approval, as outlined in reference (a), is required for U.S. manufactured IFF Mode 4/5 systems' integration into non-U.S. manufactured platforms. Transfers of Mark XIIA IFF Mode 4/5 systems are based on validated interoperability requirements.
