The generic term Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) encompasses all DoD elements, regardless of actual title, located in a foreign country to carry out security cooperation (SC) and SA management functions under the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title22/html/USCODE-2021-title22-chap32.htm" target="_blank">FAA</a> and the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title22/html/USCODE-2021-title22-chap39.htm" target="_blank">Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1976, as amended.</a>, as amended. The SCO also manages DoD SC programs under the guidance of the Combatant Command (CCMD).</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.1.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.1.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Senior Defense Official/Defense Attaché.</span> <a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/520575p.pdf" target="_blank">DoD Directive 5205.75</a>, DoD operations at U.S. embassies, creates the position of Senior Defense Official/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) as the principal DoD official in U.S. embassies and establishes the SDO/DATT as the diplomatically accredited defense attaché and chief of the SCO. As such the SDO/DATT is responsible for advancing U.S. foreign policy goals under the ambassador, promoting the Combatant Commander’s (CCDR’s) theater campaign plan objectives, and complying with <a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/520575p.pdf" target="_blank">DoD Directive 5205.75</a> and <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/C510581_placeholder.pdf" target="_blank">DoD Instruction (DoDI) C-5105.81</a>, "Implementing Instructions for DoD Operations at U.S. Embassies."</p>

<p class="SAMM_L1"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle"> Key Relationships.</span> The SCO is responsible for the development and maintenance of professional working relationships that advance U.S. strategic objectives. Key relationships include:</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.2.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.2.1.</span> </a> The SCO falls under the direction and supervision of the U.S. Chief of Mission (COM). The SCO chief’s ability to form positive professional relationships with the COM and other members of the embassy country team is critical to DoD success in synchronizing priorities and efforts with other agencies.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.2.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.2.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">The Combatant Command.</span> The SCO falls under the command and supervision of the CCDR in matters that are not functions or responsibilities of the COM. The SDO/DATT ensures compatibility of DoD and Department of State (State) policies and promotes complementary use of resources.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.2.3."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.2.3.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">The Partner Nation.</span> The DoD relies upon the SCO to effectively interface with partner nation counterparts and leadership. SCO personnel must understand partner nation national and military objectives and strategies, be familiar with partner nation capabilities and requirements, and have access to appropriate partner nation counterparts and leaders.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.2.4."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.2.4.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">United States Defense Industry.</span> It is in the U.S. national security and economic interests that if a country intends to purchase a defense article it be of U.S. origin. Consequently, SCOs provide assistance to U.S. companies while maintaining strict neutrality between U.S. competitors. See <a href="/chapter/chapter-2#C2.1.8.">Section C2.1.8.</a> for more details on SCO support to industry.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.1.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Participation in Development of Strategies and Plans.</span> The SCO’s responsibility for evaluating partner nation capabilities and conducting necessary planning to meet requirements is specified in FAA Section 515(a) and is central to the military assistance planning and budget cycles of both DoD and State. The SCO Chief plays a central role in SA strategy development and program planning and an important role in the development of all other DoD, CCMD, Component Command, and Military Department (MILDEP) activities to ensure these activities are supportive of U.S. regional and country-specific military strategies; are appropriate to partner nation needs and political and cultural sensitivities; and promote rationalization, standardization, and interoperability within the partner nation forces and with the United States.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Theater Campaign Plans.</span> A Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) implements the CCDR’s theater strategy and provides a comprehensive framework to integrate SC activities, ongoing operations, and contingency plan “Phase 0” shaping activities. TCPs serve as the integrating framework that informs and synchronizes all subordinate and supporting organization planning and operations toward the achievement of DoD Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF) end-states. The SC portions of the TCP is directed by the CCMD J5 and typically involves a series of regional and country-focused theater security cooperation working groups. The SCO and/or SDO/DATT, and DoD and interagency representatives participate in these working groups.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.2.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.2.1.</span> </a> SCOs focus upon the country-specific component of the SC plan, commonly called the Country Plan, which specifies the CCDR’s near and mid-term objectives and desired end-states for SC with a given country and describes the methods to be used in obtaining them. CCMDs and other DoD agencies refer to country plans when formulating input into Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET) budget requests, and when determining activities and projects to support using Title 10 funds.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.2.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.2.2.</span> </a> SCOs shape development of country plans via regular contact with CCMD J5 country desk officers, and through the CCMD J5-sponsored regional and country-focused working groups scheduled throughout the year. A firm understanding of the CCMD TCP is essential to the SCO in advocating DoD and CCMD priorities and strategies to the U.S. embassy country team and partner nation, and in planning and budgeting resources to support TCP country-specific objectives. Ideally, CCMD SC planning events are scheduled such that SCOs are well-prepared to provide input to the COM’s Mission Strategic Resources Plan.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.3."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.3.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Integrated Country Strategy/Mission Resource Request.</span> The Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) is the four-year strategy that articulates the U.S. priorities in a given country and is led by the COM. The ICS develops a common set of mission goals and objectives through a coordinated and collaborative planning effort among State and other USG agencies with programming in-country. Higher-level planning documents and strategies, such as the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, the State-U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Joint Strategic Plan, and State regional and functional bureau strategies inform the ICS.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.3.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.3.1.</span> </a> Once completed, the ICS frames and informs the annual Mission Resource Request (MRR) and mission-level performance management requirements. Once approved by the COM, the quadrennial ICS is submitted for State and interagency review.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.3.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.3.2.</span> </a> For countries eligible to receive foreign aid, including military assistance, the annual MRR is the first step in the State and USAID budget formulation process. Each mission uses the MRR to describe the Diplomatic Engagement and Foreign Assistance resources required to advance the nation’s foreign policy goals and make progress on the mission objectives articulated in their ICS.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.3.3."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.3.3.</span> </a> The SCO chief's participation in ICS/MRR development is key to securing the COM’s support for any DoD executed, Title 22 funded activity/engagement with the partner nation.</p>

The preparation and submission of these requests is a coordinated effort between SCO and CCMD staff.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.4.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.4.1.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Consistency with Mission Strategic Resource Plan.</span> SCO FMF/IMET budget requests and justifications are used by DoD representatives in State-led interagency discussions during the final stages of development of the State budget submission. DoD FMF/IMET proposals not consistent with the COM’s ICS/MRR will be at-risk for exclusion from the final budget.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.4.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.4.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Unconstrained Submissions.</span> When drafting budget submissions, the SCO includes all identified requirements of the partner nation regardless of historical FMF/IMET allocations for that country. Although a particular project may be prioritized well outside FMF/IMET budget estimates for that country, the CCMD may retain the SCO’s total budget request in the automated system so that the original SCO submission will be visible to all DoD and State participants in the budget allocation process. By identifying all partner nation requirements in the request, the SCO establishes priorities and alternatives should additional funds become available.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.4.3."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.4.3.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Uncommitted Funds.</span> Funding provided under FMF grant-aid is obligated upon apportionment, and the funds remain available in the country’s FMF Trust account indefinitely. However, annual budget submissions must explain the accumulation of uncommitted funds in the trust account. Uncommitted funds can weaken SCO justification for future FMF. SCOs should monitor and manage SA programs to ensure against the accumulation of uncommitted funds.</p>

SCOs encourage pursuit of U.S. military equipment and training appropriate to the partner nation's strategic environment, technical capability, and ability to reasonably afford and maintain this equipment.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.1.3.6.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.1.3.6.2.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Avoiding False Impressions.</span> SCOs must avoid creating false impressions of USG readiness to make available military materiel, technology, or information. Without specific existing authority, the only information that may be shared with a partner nation is that which has been cleared for public release. Therefore, planning and coordination with foreign governments concerning programs that might involve the eventual disclosure of military information may be conducted only if such action is coordinated with a designated disclosure official from the DoD organization with purview over the information or materiel. Further, SCOs must ensure partner nation representatives understand and acknowledge that no U.S. commitment to furnish information or materiel is intended or implied until disclosure has been approved. Finally, SCOs must also avoid creating false impressions of USG willingness or ability to provide resources to the partner nation (e.g., appropriated funds such as FMF or equivalent support such as an exercise related construction project) before receiving official notification of approval through USG channels.</p>

Based on these agreements, SCOs should have a working knowledge of the host country’s acquisition system. In conjunction with the embassy commercial attaché, the SCO should have a process for obtaining procurement information on bid solicitations. Such information should be obtained at the same time as bid solicitations are provided to in-country suppliers. Reciprocal agreement and host country solicitation information should be provided to appropriate U.S. industry representatives. The exchange of information between the SCO and the industry representative is used to monitor host country compliance with the reciprocal agreement. If the SCO suspects that U.S. companies do not have equal access to the host country defense market or if U.S. industry representatives can provide information that indicates an agreement is not being honored, the SCO works with the embassy commercial attaché to resolve the issue and advise the host country procurement officials and appropriate OSD offices. Existing reciprocal procurement agreements can be found on the Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy's website: <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/ic/reciprocal-procurement-mou.html" target="_blank">International Contracting - Reciprocal Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy Memoranda of Understanding.</a></p>

Industry representatives make appointments with country officials to avoid the impression of SCO endorsement of a given item or service. The SCO makes the appointment only if the host country desires that appointments be made through the SCO. The SCO may attend key meetings to help assess defense requirements and the extent of U.S. industries’ ability to meet those requirements, if requested by the industry representatives and the host government. Thirty days in advance of initial visits, defense industry representatives should provide SCOs: a synopsis of equipment and services proposed for sale; current export license information, including restrictions and provisos; dates of planned in-country travel; non-proprietary information already provided to the host country, or other contacts concerning this equipment or service; and specific support (briefings, appointments) requested.

The SCO must maintain neutrality between U.S. competitors. When more than one U.S. competitor is involved, the SCO should explain to host country personnel why a U.S. system would be to the country’s advantage. If asked by a representative of one U.S. company, the SCO can acknowledge whether and when other U.S. vendors have come through the country but should not divulge any marketing strategy or other proprietary information of any U.S. competitor. In cases where it is clear that there is only one U.S. source or producer marketing a system, the SCO may generally endorse a specific American product to the host Government. If it has not already been communicated to the SCO that a specific product or capability is to be supported, the SCO may inquire from DSCA whether the DoD can actively participate in supporting a specific sale.</p>

Unless the host country requests the purchase be made through FMS, the DoD tries to accommodate the U.S. contractor’s preference for DCS. In addition, normally the DoD does not provide price quotes for comparison of FMS to DCS. To avoid any pricing discrepancies and to ensure that the SCOs provide accurate Price &amp; Availability (P&amp;A) data, inquiries on pricing are referred to the appropriate MILDEP and/or DSCA (See <a href="/chapter/chapter-5">Chapter 5</a>). All sales, either FMS or DCS, may include differences in delivery schedules, equipment modifications, spare parts, and training packages, and the recipient should exercise caution in comparing FMS and DCS data. The SCO assists a broad spectrum of U.S. defense industry marketing efforts, and the SCO is expected to provide adequate support to vendors regardless of the complexity or price of the item.</p>

The SCO chief alerts embassy staff to observe reactions of the host country officials on U.S. defense industry marketing efforts.

The IA is responsible for maintaining current information regarding the CM in the Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS).</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.2.1.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.2.1.2.</span> </a> Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases vary in dollar value and complexity. For example, a $25 million sale of a major weapon system is extremely complex compared to a $10 million LOA for off-the-shelf replacement spares. Although the two differ in dollar value and complexity, they both require special attention (even a very low value case may involve many different functional activities) and should be managed in accordance with well-defined guidelines. The level of case management will depend on the purchaser's expertise and previous experience with the weapon system, budget constraints, familiarity with FMS, etc.</p>

The CM achieves successful performance when the case objectives are met. These objectives are to: provide all articles or services included in the case on schedule, within the stated value; and close the case in a timely manner.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L1"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.2.4."> <span class="PNumber">C2.2.4.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle">Authority.</span> FMS cases require concentrated management effort.

Effective case management depends on the performance and interaction of many organizations. The CM must have the authority to take action and task other organizations in the day-to-day management of a case.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L1"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.2.5."> <span class="PNumber">C2.2.5.</span> </a> If any situation arises that puts at risk the USG’s ability to meet a commitment made to an international partner or that results in an operational, political, or readiness impact to the international partner or CCMD priority case, the CM is responsible to forward the matter through the appropriate MILDEP/Defense Agency FMS channel to alert the DSCA (Office of International Operations, Regional Execution Directorate (IOPS/REX)) Country Portfolio Director (CPD)/(Office of Business Operations, Financial Policy &amp; Regional Execution Directorate (OBO/FPRE)) Country Finance Director (CFD) in writing. The purpose of this communication is to inform the broader security cooperation (SC) enterprise in advance and coordinate a unified response to the international partner. However, if the situation also poses an immediate safety risk (to include safety of flight, safety of use, etc.) to the international partner’s use of delivered defense articles, instead of prompting a fully coordinated response, the IA will immediately notify the international partner of the safety risk with an information copy sent to the DSCA CPD/CFD and appropriate MILDEP/Defense Agency FMS channel.

The CM serves as the central point of contact, and acts as the U.S. representative to the FMS customer for questions and problem resolution. To this end, the CM develops a program master plan that separates the case into management components, indicates significant activities in the execution of the case, and establishes an implementation schedule. The plan is drawn from more detailed program planning documents used by the program office and is tailored to fit the complexity of the case. A program master plan is required for "major sales" as described in <a href="/chapter/chapter-5#C5.4.12.">Section C5.4.12.</a> This includes sales that trigger Arms Export Control Act (AECA) section 36(b) <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title22/html/USCODE-2021-title22-chap39-subchapIII-sec2776.htm" target="_blank">(22 U.S.C. 2776)</a> ("36(b)") thresholds and proposed sales that represent an increase of more than fifteen percent to the FMS purchaser's current active program. A program master plan may also be required for other sales as determined by the DSCA OBO/FPRE and/or the IA. The master plan can be in any format, such as a quad chart or plan of action and milestones (POAM). Depending on the size or nature of the case, the plan covers: case description, key milestones (contract status, transportation plan, delivery schedule, training, contractor support, etc.); status, issues/risk; along with key points of contact and responsibilities. The CM provides the master plan to higher authority and to the FMS customer to forecast events and track progress. The master plan will be updated and reissued after significant project milestones, prior to program management reviews (PMRs), and as part of the development of amendments to the FMS case.</p>

The USG welcomes consultation with friends and allies regarding planning to meet their defense needs or to undertake research, development, production, and logistics support programs of mutual interest. Information obtained through consultation is important in the planning process and helps ensure orderly program implementation.</p>

The amount and type of military equipment that a country can support is also considered. SC plans emphasize the country’s capabilities to organize, employ, and manage national resources allocated to defense.

Military assistance funding, appropriated by the U.S. Congress, is provided to DoD by State to execute the authorities in Foreign Assistance Act (FAA), section 503(a) <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2021-title22/USCODE-2021-title22-chap32-subchapII-partII-sec2311" target="_blank">(22 U.S.C. 2311 (a))</a> and Section 541 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title22/html/USCODE-2021-title22-chap32-subchapII-partV-sec2347.htm" target="_blank">(22 U.S.C. 2347)</a> and Arm Export Control Act (AECA), Section 23 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2021-title22/USCODE-2021-title22-chap39-subchapII-sec2763" target="_blank">(22 U.S.C. 2763)</a>. Military assistance funding is administered by DSCA. Annual preparation of military assistance budgets is for requesting funding, if realized, will be executed two years in the future.</p>

PM sets the deadline for the DoD budget submission. DSCA (Office of Business Operations (OBO)) is responsible for preparing and releasing the budget call to the Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs) and geographic Combatant Commands (CCMDs).</p>

Approved regional Theater Security Cooperation Plans are also used in developing the annual FMF and IMET Budget recommendation. FMF and IMET Budget requests should reflect the SECDEF’s strategic priorities and fiscal guidance issued for the annual budget build.</p>

The web tool provides a central, on-line repository of FMF and IMET budgetary data that provides a timely, efficient, and visible method for budget development and subsequent reporting.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L3"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.3.3.1.4."> <span class="PNumber">C2.3.3.1.4.</span> </a> <span class="PTitle"> Scope of Military Assistance Budget Submissions.</span> Military Assistance funding is a key tool in promoting foreign policy and national security objectives. As such, it is imperative, based on the congressionally mandated National Security Assistance Strategy (NSAS) reporting, that DoD incorporates a long-term strategy into the Military Assistance Budget process. Therefore, budget submissions must incorporate the following elements: out-year program requirements; objective-oriented input detailing what needs to be accomplished and why, the capability being created, enhanced, or maintained, how long it will take to achieve the objective, and the desired end state; justifications that detail what is required in the way of materiel and/or services and why this is critical in meeting the stated objective; prioritization of requirements; and funding requests that are consistent with the purpose of the source of funding being sought. Funding requests for countries that maintain high uncommitted FMF balances are highly scrutinized. Therefore, a general plan on how this funding will be used and a timeframe for the timely commitment of these balances must also be provided.</p>

The Integrated Country Strategy (ICS)/Mission Resource Request (MRR) reflects the Chief of Mission’s (COM’s) views on required funding, which may differ from the SCO's views. The MRR input is tasked separately by State. The SCO should use the data it compiled for the DoD FMF and IMET Budget call as the basis for input to any tasking received for the MRR in accordance with the CCMD guidance.</p>

They include fiscal constraints, policy and political concerns, sanctions, schoolhouse capacity, effective and efficient use of previously provided funding, and availability of other SC funds.</p>

This State-approved document further justifies the budget year request for funding, sets the baseline for congressional program content notification for execution year funding, and outlines a spend plan for prior year uncommitted FMF funds. The FMF program baseline must be followed when submitting Letters of Request (LORs) and executing Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) unless a deviation is sought from the DSCA (OBO, Financial Policy &amp; Regional Execution Directorate (FPRE)) Country Finance Director (CFD) and approved by the State.</p>

</div>

<p class="SAMM_L1"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.4.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.4.1.</span> </a> When requested by a country, Security Assistance Survey Teams are organized to conduct surveys in-country to review military capabilities and to make recommendations for meeting security cooperation (SC) objectives. These teams generally are funded by a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case and can include a combination of USG personnel, representatives of the host nation, and commercial contractors. A comprehensive survey of a country’s military capabilities may be requested to provide a baseline for a new program. Surveys may also be conducted as part of an ongoing program to address specific needs. Types of surveys include defense requirements surveys, site surveys, general surveys or studies, and engineering assessment surveys. <a href="/chapter/chapter-2#C2.F1.">Figure C2.F1.</a> provides information regarding survey teams, their roles, and reporting requirements. Logistics conferences for program definition are excluded from these requirements.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.4.2.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.4.2.1.</span> </a> DSCA organizes and deploys Expeditionary Requirements Generation Teams (ERGTs) to augment Combatant Command (CCMD) staffs and Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs) with SC expertise in support of planning and execution of capability-building efforts. ERGTs assist CCMDs and SCOs with translating partner nation capability needs into well-defined and specific requirements for use in the preparation of high-quality partner nation Letters of Request (LORs) and subsequent USG Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs).</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.4.2.2."> <span class="PNumber">C2.4.2.2.</span> </a> Upon receiving a CCMD request for ERGT support, DSCA coordinates with the requesting CCMD, appropriate Military Departments (MILDEPs), DoD agencies, and interagency stakeholders and then organizes and deploys ERGTs to support and augment CCMD staffs and SCOs on a temporary, as-needed, basis.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.4.2.3."> <span class="PNumber">C2.4.2.3.</span> </a> Though ERGTs may be formed to meet a wide spectrum of CCMD and SCO needs, ERGTs primarily focus on assisting SCOs to define requirements and develop comprehensive solutions. ERGT size and composition are based on the situation and objectives described by the CCMD in the request for ERGT support and can be built around either a country or regional focus, and may be deployed to a partner nation, to the CCMD headquarters, or can provide “virtual” augmentation from Washington, D.C. using the full spectrum of information and communications technologies.</p>

<p class="SAMM_L2"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.4.2.4."> <span class="PNumber">C2.4.2.4.</span> </a> In some cases, an ERGT may be viewed as a type of Security Assistance Survey Team, but an ERGT is neither synonymous with, nor a replacement for, Security Assistance Survey Team. Questions on ERGTs should be directed to DSCA (Office of International Operations, Regional Execution Directorate (IOPS/REX)).</p>

<p class="SAMM_L1"><a class="PNumber" id="C2.5.1."> <span class="PNumber">C2.5.1.</span> </a> Materiel Notices inform countries of events that impact their ability to acquire or support an item through Foreign Military Sales (FMS). They normally call for submission of a Letter of Request (LOR) officially requesting the items or associated support. Implementing Agencies (IAs) prepare notice messages or letters when U.S. production of an item is scheduled to end, or the United States is making a periodic buy of items that may have foreign demand. The IA coordinates proposed notices with the involved DoD Components and then with DSCA, which in turn coordinates with the Department of State (State) prior to release. Correspondence should include a rationale for issuing the notification, the deadline for receipt of an LOR, and the final date for acceptance and subsequent implementation of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) Notices are sent only to countries that have shown interest in the items and are eligible to purchase the items under the National Disclosure Policy (NDP) as implemented in <a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/523011p.pdf" target="_blank">DoD Directive (DoDD) 5230.11, Disclosure of Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations</a>. “Interest” includes previous purchase (via FMS or commercial), request for Price and Availability (P&amp;A) data, or purchase of related weapon systems that use the items.</p>
